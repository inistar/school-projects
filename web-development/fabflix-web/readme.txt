Regarding AutoCompletion Search Bar:
In order for the suggestion box to appear, the mouse has to hover the search box. The suggestion box will disappear once the mouse is pointed outside of the search box area.
We believe this is helpful for the user experience because when the user points his/her mouse at other area, it indicates that he/she is not interested in using the search box at the moment.
Therefore, the suggestion box should be disappear to show all the other options for the user.
